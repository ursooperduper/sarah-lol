# Notes

For the first prompt, I decided to grab a profile pic of myself and create a shape-based grid to render 
it onscreen. As the prompt called for the use of a single color, I decided to use a blend mode to bend the
rule slightly and use a single color, but get a bonus color out of it. But layering to grids on top of each 
other at different sizes and then playing with the sizes of the shapes, the interplay between the spacing of 
the grid and the shapes themselves gives the illustration of different shapes.
