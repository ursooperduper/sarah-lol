# Notes

I took a very literal interpretation of the prompt. The 12 principles of animation made me think of the flour sack animation exercise animators do where they take a basic inanimate object and bring it to life. I wanted to take a basic element, a line, and do the same thing. Animations were easy with a straight line, but not particularly fun or interesting. But when I turned the line into a bezier with anchors and control points, it really brought a sense of a life and energy to the exercise.
