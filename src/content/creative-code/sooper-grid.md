SOOPERgrid is an interactive tool for creating dynamic grid-based compositions. The recursive grid creation algorithm generates endless variations of layouts, each with unique color palettes and geometric arrangements.

Features include:

- Real-time generation with customizable parameters
- Export functionality (SVG & PNG)
- Random color palettes (2-9 colors in each palette)
- Shape and pattern variants

Built with <a href="https://p5.js" target="_blank">P5.js</a>, I created SOOPERgrid to explore recursive grids and how to create custom tools to make art that can be exported as SVG assets for post-processing elsewhere.
